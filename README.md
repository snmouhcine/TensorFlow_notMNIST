In this lab, you'll use all the tools you learned from *Introduction to TensorFlow* to label images of English letters! 
The data you are using, consists of images of a letter from A to J in differents font.  
The above images are a few examples of the data you'll be training on. 
After training the network, you will compare your prediction model against test data. Your goal, by the end of this lab, 
is to make predictions against that test set with at least an 80% accuracy. Let's jump in!
